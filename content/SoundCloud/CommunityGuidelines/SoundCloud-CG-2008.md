# Cloudlines (SoundCloud Community Guidelines)
The following Community Guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to be a member of SoundCloud and to ensure that all members have a good time here. Don't forget that your use of SoundCloud is also subject to our Terms of Use.

## Does
* Always be nice
There's a lot of different people here with a lot of different opinions and views. That's great but it also means that everybody should have a high level of tolerance and be nice to people with ideas that are different than their own.

* Share content that you own the rights to
Always respect the right holders of a piece of music and never ever share stolen music, period. If you suspect somebody of breaking the rules please report it right away to us at abuse@soundcloud.com

* Give us a link
Through the widgets it's possible to put tracks hosted on SoundCloud on other websites and this is really great. However, we're picking up the bandwidth bill each month and would in return really appreciate that you link back to us whenever you post Soundcloud hosted content elsewhere on the web.

* Criticize, but do it constructively
Criticism is really good for pushing things forward and making things better. So, please constructively share your opinion so that good things can come out of it. As much as constructive criticism can make things better, unconstructive criticism makes things worse. Always think for a second before posting critique, "Would I appreciate receiving the same comment?".

## Don'ts
* Upload things that aren't yours to upload
This of course means music but also texts & images that you might have found around the web. Uploading and sharing means you should always be certain that you are the creator or the creator of what you're uploading has given you permission share.

* Share music without the consent of the proper right holders
Any user sharing music illegally runs the risk of having their SoundCloud account deleted and being reported to the relevant authorities. SoundCloud makes it easy for people to send & receive music, please help us in making sure it's all legal music.

* Rant, flame, troll or be an asshole
SoundCloud is a social place but it's not the place for you to act out rage from other parts of your life. Don't let a personal issue strain the rest of the community. Inappropriate behavior will put you in risk of having your account deleted.

## To Sum It Up
Basically, be nice, follow the law and think before you post. In most cases we'll send you a warning before we take other measures and we'll always try to be reasonable. However, if you don't feel these guidelines are appropriate, maybe SoundCloud is not for you.

These guidelines have been written down to ensure that everyone within the community has the experience they want. We're not trying to set up rules and regulations for exactly how you should and shouldn't act but rather make clear that this should be a place of respect between people and responsible content posting. We hope you agree and understand. If you do, don't or have any other questions or comments please let us know.
