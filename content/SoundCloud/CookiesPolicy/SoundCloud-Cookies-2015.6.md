# SoundCloud Cookies Policy
This Cookies Policy forms part of our general Privacy Policy. You can read the full Privacy Policy.

In common with most other websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand how people use SoundCloud® so that we can keep improving our Platform. We have created this Cookies Policy to provide you with clear and explicit information about the technologies that we use on SoundCloud®, and your choices when it comes to these technologies.

If you choose to use the Platform without blocking or disabling cookies or opting out of other technologies, you will indicate your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies and to our use (in accordance with this policy and the rest of our Privacy Policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies. If you do not consent to the use of these technologies, please be sure to block or disable them using your browser settings, the opt-out links identified in this policy, or the settings within our mobile apps.

## What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. These text files can be read by these websites and help to identify you when you return to a website. Cookies can be “persistent” or “session” cookies. Persistent cookies remain on your computer when you have gone offline, while session cookies are deleted as soon as you close your web browser.

To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to block and delete cookies, please visit http://www.aboutcookies.org/.

## SoundCloud Cookies
We use our own cookies to recognise you when you visit our website or use our apps. This means that you don’t have to log in each time you visit, and we can remember your preferences and settings.

Those cookies with one- or two-letter names (such as “a”, “c” or “qc”) are SoundCloud cookies.

## Third Party Cookies
In addition to our own cookies, we work with various reputable companies to help us analyse how the Platform is used, and to optimise our Website and Apps to deliver the best possible experience. The following companies help us achieve this through use of cookies:

### Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer
Google Analytics and Google Website Optimizer are services provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use our website, our mobile site and any SoundCloud® players embedded on third party sites. Google Web Optimzer uses the same cookies to measure how different users respond to different content. The information generated by these cookies (including your truncated IP address) is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other users’, use of our website, mobile site and SoundCloud® players, compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Please note that Google only receives your truncated IP address. This is sufficient for Google to identify (approximately) the country from which you are visiting our sites or accessing our players, but is not sufficient to identify you, or your computer or mobile device, individually.

Google cookies are those beginning “__ut”.

You can find more information here, including a link to Google’s privacy policy.

### Google AdWords and Google Remarketing
We use the online advertising program Google AdWords and the Google Remarketing technology, both operated by the company Google Inc. ("Google") .

For measuring conversion with Google AdWords, a conversion tracking cookie is placed when a user clicks on a SoundCloud advertisement delivered by Google (“Ads”). Conversion tracking cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. Google uses a different cookie for each Google AdWords customer and there is no consolidation of the cookie data with other data. If you click on one of our Ads and proceed to a page equipped with a conversion tag and the cookie has not yet expired, the conversion is documented. With the help of the conversion tracking cookie we see the total number of conversions and are able to review the performance of our Ads. You can find more information about Google AdWords here.

When you click on one of our Ads, a Google Remarketing cookie is placed. This cookie helps to serve our Ads to you at a later time when you browse pages of the Google content network. Remarketing cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. For more information on Google Remarketing, please see here.

Google cookies are those beginning “__ut”.

## Similar Technologies
In addition to cookies, we also use the following standard Internet technologies in connection with your use of the Platform:

* Clear GIFs: We use “clear GIFs”, sometimes known as “web bugs”, which are small image files that we embed into our email newsletters. These clear GIFs tell us whether you opened the newsletter, clicked on any of the content or forwarded the newsletter to someone else. This provides us with useful information regarding the effectiveness of our email newsletters, which we can use to ensure that we are delivering information that is relevant to our users.

* Flash cookies: We use Flash cookies to synchronise information between multiple SoundCloud® players. This ensures that one player is stopped when another player starts. We do not use Flash cookies for the purposes of collecting any personal data, and do not use Flash cookies to respawn any cookies that you might previously have deleted.

* HTML5 local storage: We use HTML5 local storage to store your default listening volume (i.e. the volume at which you prefer to hear sounds on SoundCloud®) and, in the case of pro users, to set the widget control colour. If you access the mobile version of our website, we use HTML5 local storage to store certain cookie data, including your user plan, authentication data, your username and your display preferences. We further use HTML5 local storage to store the track IDs of the last 250 sounds you have listened to. This information helps us to suggest content that you might enjoy when you visit the Platform without being logged in or when you sign up for a SoundCloud account. Depending on your browser you can remove local storage when clearing your cache and cookies. We do not use HTML5 local storage to collect any personal data.

* Activity tracking: We work with Localytics, a service provided by Char Software, Inc ("Localytics") to collect usage data from our iOS and Android mobile apps in order to help us understand how users are interacting with our apps. Localytics is used to track activities within the app such as likes, follows and plays. This information, including your IP address, is transmitted and stored by Localytics on servers in the United States. For more information see Localytics' privacy policy. If you wish to opt out of Localytics tracking, please see the Opting Out section below.

* App performance tracking: Our mobile apps use the app performance and analysis technology “adjust.io”, a service provided by Adjust GmbH ("Adjust"). When you launch the SoundCloud app, Adjust collects install and event data such as the number of sounds played and the listening time from our iOS and Android mobile apps in order to help us understand how our users are interacting with our apps and to optimise and analyse mobile ad campaigns. For such analysis, Adjust uses your anonymized (hashed) IDFA or Android ID, and your anonymized (hashed) IP- and MAC address. The hashes used are one-way hashes and it is not possible to identify you or your mobile device individually. If you wish to opt-out of Adjust tracking, please see the Opting Out section below.

* Bug reporting: We work with Crashlytics, Inc (“Crashlytics”) and Bit Stadium GmbH (“HockeyApp”) to report any bug affecting our iOS and Android mobile apps. HockeyApp’s software is built into our iOS app and Crashlytics' software is built into our Android app. If either app crashes during normal use, the app will send certain information about the incident to Crashlytics or HockeyApp as applicable. This information consists of the device type, OS version and certain hardware information about your mobile device, and the time of the crash, the state of the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces. The information does not include your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you or your mobile device individually, and does not include any other information from your mobile device. Click here to review Crashlytics' privacy policy, and here for HockeyApp’s privacy policy. To opt out of bug reporting please see the Opting Out section below.

* Personalized advertising on mobile devices: Where cookie technology is not available other unique identifiers may be used instead (e.g. in mobile applications), which perform similar functions, such as IDFA, Android-ID or the Google Advertiser ID. To opt-out of identifiers on mobile, please see the Opting Out section below.
