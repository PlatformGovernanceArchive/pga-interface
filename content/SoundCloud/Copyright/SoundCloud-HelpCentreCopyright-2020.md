## My track was taken down
### Why your track was taken down

[dynamic page]

We’d love to help give a better understanding about why your track was identified, and taken down for copyright infringement.

What kind of track was it?
My own original track
A DJ Mix
A mashup
A cover version
A remix
A track I bought
A track I composed with someone else
An entry for a remix competition or contest
Someone else’s track
My spoken word podcast
A radio show
A track in the public domain

### My track was taken down for copyright infringement

Beginning in 2010, SoundCloud has used automated content identification to protect our creators' copyright. When you upload a track, our system checks your upload against a database of tracks that copyright owners have asked us to block.

If the system detects a match, then your upload is blocked, because that’s what the copyright owner has asked us to do. We also run the system in the background to make sure that we’re picking up infringing content on an ongoing basis after upload. If the system detects a match, the track will be automatically removed. 

### What to do if your track was taken down for copyright infringement

If a track gets flagged by our automated system or gets reported manually for containing copyright protected material, that track is removed from your profile until the dispute can be resolved. The process is exactly the same whether you’re a bedroom DJ or an A-list artist.

Mistakes can be made, particularly when using automated systems — sometimes tracks get mistakenly identified, and sometimes they get blocked when the person uploading them has the right to post them. If your track was blocked although you have the relevant rights or permissions in place, please file a dispute to have the track checked and reinstated on your profile. 

If the content has been correctly identified, please answer “yes” to the question "Was my content correctly identified by the content ID system?" when filing a dispute. However if our system mistook your upload for another copyrighted track, answer “no” to this question. In these cases our copyright team will compare your upload to the identified material and reinstate it if your dispute is accepted. 

Please note: Based on current copyright legislation, you can only upload tracks to your account that you own the copyrights for or have the appropriate licenses or permissions to share. This also includes tracks that you have purchased or downloaded from other sources online — you would always need that content’s rights holder’s permission.

### What is a dispute?

Whenever a track is taken down for copyright infringement, you have the possibility to contest the takedown via our online disputing process. 

A dispute is your opportunity to let us know if you have rights and permissions in place for a track that has been blocked for copyright infringement.You can file a dispute against a copyright takedown if you believe that your track has been removed incorrectly.

To file a dispute you can fill in our form where you’ll be asked to describe your rights to the track that has been blocked and our Copyright Team will review your claim.

### Valid and invalid reasons to file a dispute

SoundCloud sees many reasons given as the basis for disputes, although a lot of these reasons are not legally valid. Below are some of the common reasons for filing a dispute, along with an explanation of why it is valid or not. Please note that any dispute filed based on an invalid reason as listed below will be rejected by SoundCloud’s Copyright Team.


#### I bought the track online and/or own the CD or vinyl
Buying a copy of a music track digitally or physically does not give you the right to share that track on SoundCloud. Online distribution is a right that belongs to the copyright owner and is not automatically transferred with your digital or physical purchase.
 

#### I only used a small part of the copyright work
Generally, if you are using someone else's copyright work, you need their permission to post that work on SoundCloud, whether it's the whole thing or just a small part (e.g. a sample).
 

#### I used someone else's work, but I created something new
Did you have permission from all copyright owners to use their work?  If not, we won’t be able to accept your dispute.
 

#### I'm not earning any money from it
You still need the copyright owner(s)’ permission even if you are not making any money from it.
 

#### Other tracks on SoundCloud contain the same copyrighted content
Permission to use or publish copyrighted material is granted on individual basis by the copyright owner(s). The fact that someone else may have permission to use the same content does not mean that it is freely available for everyone to use. A separate license has to be obtained for each case.
 

#### I got it as a free download and want to share it
Some creators may give away their album or track as free download.  Generally that gives you the right to download and listen to it only. That doesn’t mean you can post it on SoundCloud.  You still need permission from all copyright owner(s) even if they have made the track available for free elsewhere.
 

#### I credit the original creator
A copyright notice or credit is often a condition of a license, but it is not a substitute for a license. You still need permission from the copyright owner(s), even if you give them credit.
 

#### I'm a big fan of the artist and want everyone to hear their music
That’s great, but have the copyright owner(s) told you that they’re OK with you posting their music on SoundCloud? Most creators want control over where their content appears and if you don’t have permission from all copyright owners to post the track, your dispute will be rejected.
 

#### I think my use is fair, so it must be fair use
Fair use in the US, and similar concepts elsewhere, allow limited use of copyrighted works in limited circumstances, for example, education and private study, and news reporting.  Fair use is a complicated thing - many factors need to be taken into account, including the amount of the copyrighted work that is used, how it is used, and the effect this has on the original copyrighted work.  Each situation needs to be considered individually. Nevertheless, (for example) it is highly unlikely that including a track in a DJ mix or mashup, remixing a track, or posting a track because you think it is good promotion for the artist, will be considered fair use. 

### Content ownership in the dispute process

If a track has been taken down from your account, it has either been recognized by our content identification system as containing copyrighted material or reported to us by a third-party who claims copyright on it.

In this second step of the disputing process, we need you to clarify who created or owns the content you’re uploading. This allows us to verify whether or not you are entitled to have this content on your account.

Important: Please note that “ownership” does not mean owning a digital, CD or vinyl copy of the track. It means owning the copyrights for the track.

There are 4 options to choose from. Select the one that applies to your upload.

#### 1. All my own work (or the work of someone I represent)
Choose this option if this is an original track that you created, or you are working on behalf of someone who owns all the rights to it (eg. a creator or a record label).

#### 2. My version of someone else’s song
Choose this option if your upload is a cover version of someone else’s song or if you created a remix, a remake or an edit of someone else’s song.

#### 3. My creation, but I used tracks from other creators (i.e. in a DJ mix, mashup, radio show, or podcast)
Choose this option if your upload is made of a collection of tracks from other creators such as in a DJ mix, a mashup, a radio or a podcast.

#### 4. Entirely someone else’s creation
Choose this option if you did not create this track yourself, or if you bought it online or got it as a free download.

### If your own content was identified and flagged as infringement
If your own content was identified and flagged as infringement
If your artist or band name appears in the messages we send you when a track is removed from your account, it’s likely that your label or your digital distributor has submitted your content to protect its publication on SoundCloud.

This also means that your content is blocked from unauthorized uploads. Yay! The downside of such a system is that it may at first prevent you, as the rights holder, from uploading material you have the rights to as well.

One quick and easy way to solve this problem and get your track back up on your account is to file a dispute with us. Our Copyright Team can see the metadata associated with each track that is taken down by the content identification system. If there is a clear match between your profile name and the identified track, they will reinstate your track quickly. If this is not apparent, make sure to give us as much information as you can when you file our web form, in order to help the Copyright Team establish the relationship between your profile and the identified track.  
 
#### How to prevent this from happening again
If you want the content identification system to stop blocking your music when you upload it to SoundCloud in the future, we recommend you to get in touch with a representative of your label or your digital distributor. They will be able to authorize your account so that you can upload your own music.

### Filling out the copyright claim form
In order to complete the dispute process, we ask you in this last step to fill out our web form. All information submitted in this form must be accurate. The formalized dispute is an important requirement of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) counter-notification process and it will be reviewed manually by our Copyright Team.
 
#### Verify your choices
On the top of the page, you can review the choices that you’ve made in the previous steps of the disputing process and if something is incorrect, you can go back and change it.

#### Describe your rights in more detail
Once you verified your choices, you are requested to describe your rights to the track in detail. We want you to give us as much relevant information as possible and we’ve pre-filled the box with some examples that help us consider your dispute.

Some additional items of information you could include are:

* A link to a website where your track is being sold (iTunes, Amazon, etc.)
* Any online broadcasting license you may have in any territory.
* A screenshot of a permission given to you by the original copyright holder
* The email of your contact at your label or digital distributor

Please note: Multiple rights holders may have copyrights to the content you are uploading and that permission is generally needed from all of them.

#### Provide your contact information
You are then requested to give us accurate contact information and in case of a DMCA notice consent this information to be shared with the person who reported the copyright infringement in accordance with the standard DMCA procedure.

#### Agree with standard legal statements
Finally in order to complete the process and send your dispute to us, you are requested to agree to standard legal statements at the bottom of the web form. Please read these carefully, and if any of them do not apply to you then please reconsider whether or not you would like to file a dispute.

I have a good faith belief that the above tracks have been removed or disabled as the result of a mistake or misidentification.

* If you decide to dispute a takedown, you must have a valid reason to do so and - very importantly - tell us the truth.

I understand that SoundCloud may terminate my account if I knowingly misrepresent my right to post these tracks.​

* Giving false information is a serious breach of our terms of use and community guidelines and may lead to the termination of your account.

I acknowledge that SoundCloud is not obliged to reinstate these tracks. If SoundCloud reinstates my tracks, I agree to indemnify SoundCloud against all claims, losses and liabilities incurred by SoundCloud as the result of my tracks being reinstated.

* Making false copyright claims is an offense that can have serious legal consequences. Please be mindful of this when you decide to submit your dispute.

### Your own original track was taken down for copyright infringement
If your track was mistakenly identified as infringing on someone else’s copyright, please log into your account to file a dispute, and our Copyright Team can return the content to your profile quickly. You can file a dispute here.
 
#### My own content was correctly identified, but flagged as infringement and blocked
If your artist or band name appears in the messages we send you when a track is removed from your account, it’s likely that your label or your digital distributor has submitted your content to protect its publication on SoundCloud.

This also means that your content is safe. Yay! The downside of such a system is that it may prevent you, as the rights holder, from uploading material you have the rights to.

One quick and easy way to solve this problem and get your track back up on your account is to file a dispute with us. Our Copyright Team can see the metadata associated with each track that is taken down by our content identification system. If there is a clear match between your profile name and the creator associated with the identified track, they will reinstate your track quickly. If this is not apparent, make sure to give us as much information as you can when you file our web form, in order to help the Copyright Team establish the relationship between your profile and the identified track.  

#### How to prevent this from happening again
If you want the content identification system to stop blocking your music when you upload it to SoundCloud in the future, we recommend you to get in touch with a representative of your label or your digital distributor. They will be able to authorize your account so that you can upload your own music.

### Your DJ mix was taken down for copyright infringement

If you use parts of a track in a DJ set, please bear in mind that the original creator owns the copyright for that part in your track and, based on current copyright legislation, you will need their explicit permission to upload your DJ mix on SoundCloud.

Some producers and publishers are fine with others using their material in DJ sets, but some are not and do not want their works altered or distributed without their explicit consent.

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original rights holders to publish their material in your DJ mix on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please bear in mind that you should have permission to use all tracks that you have included in your DJ mix, and not just the one that has been detected by our content identification system. If you do not clearly specify and prove that all these permissions have been granted by their respective copyright holders (usually record labels and publishers), your dispute will be rejected.    

If you have all permissions in place, then sign into your account and fill out the dispute form here. Please link any available screenshots or images of permissions into the dispute form via a linking service. 

#### I uploaded my DJ mix under Creative Commons, why was it still taken down?
Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that has drafted a set of copyright licenses that may be used by any creator for any of their content. With Creative Commons licenses, creators have the choice to give up certain exclusive rights normally associated with copyright, while retaining others.  
 
Although you, as the creator of the DJ mix have chosen to give up certain of these exclusive rights associated with copyright, the original creator of the track you used still owns the copyright for that part in your mix, and you will need their explicit permission to publish your track on SoundCloud and to license your DJ mix, which includes the original creator’s track, under the Creative Commons License. 

#### I uploaded my DJ mix for non-commercial purposes, doesn't this qualify as fair use?
Fair use is a legal doctrine that primarily exists in the copyright law of the United States. Fair use limits the exclusive rights granted by copyright and allows the use of copyrighted material  for certain limited purposes only, without requiring permission from the rights holder and depending on the exact use of the original work to be determined on a case by case basis.  Purposes recognized under fair use may be such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching and similar activities.      ​

However, uploading a DJ mix for non-commercial and promotional purposes to SoundCloud does not fall within the fair use exemption.

### Your mashup was taken down for copyright infringement

Since a mashup is based on other creators' tracks, you'll need to make sure that the copyright owners of the works you included in your mashup are fine with you using them in your upload to SoundCloud, even in their edited form. If you created your mashup based on tracks you have downloaded or found from other online sources, you will still need the content creator’s permission to upload it to your account - crediting the original creator does not count as permission.

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the originals’ rights holders to publish their material in your mashup on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### I uploaded my mashup under Creative Commons, why was it still taken down?
Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that has drafted a set of copyright licenses that may be used by any creator for any of their content. With Creative Commons licenses, creators have the choice to give up certain exclusive rights normally associated with copyright, while retaining others.  

Although you, as the creator of the mashup have chosen to give up certain of these exclusive rights associated with copyright, the original creator of the track you used still owns the copyright for that part in your mashup, and you will need their explicit permission to publish your track on SoundCloud.

#### I uploaded my mashup for non-commercial purposes, doesn't this qualify as fair use?
Fair use is a legal doctrine that primarily exists in the copyright law of the United States. Fair use limits the exclusive rights granted by copyright and allows the use of copyrighted material  for certain limited purposes only, without requiring permission from the rights holder and depending on the exact use of the original work to be determined on a case by case basis.  Purposes recognized under fair use may be such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching and similar activities.      

However, uploading a mashup for non-commercial and promotional purposes to SoundCloud does not fall within the fair use exemption.

### Your cover version was taken down for copyright infringement

Based on current copyright legislation, you always need permissions or the appropriate licenses if you would like to cover a copyrighted song in public , as is the case when publishing a track on SoundCloud. Permissions or licenses may be needed for both the composition rights and the sound recording rights, depending on whether you're using a part of an original sound recording or have provided the vocals and played all the instruments.

While some producers and publishers are fine with third parties using their material, some others are not and do not want their works used or altered without explicit consent.

 If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the relevant rights holders or that you obtained all necessary licenses to publish your cover version on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### I uploaded my cover under Creative Commons, why was it still taken down?
Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that has drafted a set of copyright licenses that may be used by any creator for any of their content. With Creative Commons licenses, creators have the choice to give up certain exclusive rights normally associated with copyright, while retaining others.  

Although you, as the creator of the cover have chosen to give up certain of these exclusive rights associated with copyright, the original creator of the track you used still owns the copyright for the original track, and you will need their explicit permission to publish your cover version on SoundCloud. 

#### I uploaded my cover for non-commercial purposes, doesn't this qualify as fair use?

However, uploading a cover version of a track for non-commercial and promotional purposes to SoundCloud does not fall within the fair use exemption. 

### Your remix was taken down for copyright infringement

Since your remix is based on another creator's track, you'll need permission from the original creator and any other relevant rights holders before you can upload and publish your remix online.

While some producers and publishers are fine with SoundCloud members using their material, some others are not and do not want their works used or altered without explicit consent.

 If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original’s rights holders to publish your cover version on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### I uploaded my remix under Creative Commons, why was it still taken down?

However, uploading a remix for non-commercial and promotional purposes to SoundCloud does not fall within the fair use exemption. 

### A track you bought was taken down for copyright infringement

In accordance with current copyright legislation, you can only upload content that you own the  appropriate licenses for with regard to that purpose. Purchasing a track does not transfer rights to publicly publish the track - either in original or in an edited way - without explicit permission. In order to be able to upload the track to SoundCloud, you would need to get in touch with the original’s copyright holder.

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original’s rights holders to publish their content on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### I uploaded the track as private, isn't that okay? 
Even if it is for your own personal use, you won’t be allowed to upload a purchased track to your SoundCloud profile as a private track. Purchasing a track does not necessarily give you the right to upload it to an online platform or to make it available to a wider audience. As you may know it is still possible to share private tracks with other listeners. 

Remember to only upload content, both publicly and privately, that you own the copyright to or that you have the necessary rights holder permission to make a copy of and publish online. SoundCloud is using an automated content identification system that recognizes copyright protected content. If the system detects copyright protected material in a private upload, that content will be blocked.

### A track you composed with someone else was taken down for copyright infringement

Everyone who has worked on a track owns parts of the copyright of that track, and you’ll need everyone’s approval before you can upload them to SoundCloud. 

For example, if you wrote the lyrics for the track, you own the copyright to them. However, if you did not create the beat or instrumental backing, then someone else owns the copyright for that and they can request that its publication be blocked if you do not have their permission. 

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original’s rights holders for their part of the track to publish their content on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

### Your entry for a remix competition or contest was taken down for copyright infringement

There are a couple of reasons why your remix entry may have been removed from SoundCloud.

#### The competition or contest was not based on SoundCloud
The first reason that your track was removed could be that the competition was not being run on the SoundCloud Platform. If that’s the case, then you wouldn’t necessarily have the right to upload your remix to SoundCloud if the organizers of the competition has not acquired the correct permissions for that purpose.

#### The competition or contest has finished
It’s possible that the rules of the competition state that entries must be removed from accounts once a competition finishes. So, if you didn’t remove your remix in time, it may have been reported for copyright infringement.

Always be sure to read the rules of the contest before you submit your entry, and bear in mind that SoundCloud does not run any remix competitions on SoundCloud platform - we don’t make the rules!
 
#### The competition or contest is based on SoundCloud, and it hasn't finished yet. What do I do?
If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the competition/contest to publish their material in your remix on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

### You uploaded someone else's track and it was taken down for copyright infringement
In accordance with current copyright legislation, you can only upload content for which you own the appropriate licenses or for which you obtained the permission from the copyright owner(s) for that purpose. Purchasing or downloading a track does not transfer rights to publicly publish the track - either in original or in an edited way - without explicit permission. In order to be able to upload the track to SoundCloud, you would need to get in touch with the original copyright holder(s).

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original rights holders to publish their track on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### I uploaded the track as private, isn't that okay? 
Even if it is for your own personal use, you won’t necessarily be allowed to upload a track you don’t own the copyrights to to your SoundCloud profile as a private track. Buying or downloading a track does not necessarily give you the right to upload it to an online platform or to make it available to a wider audience. As you may know it is still possible to share private tracks with other listeners.

Remember to only upload content, both publicly and privately, that you own the copyright to or that you have the necessary rights holder permission to make a copy of and publish online. SoundCloud is using an automated content identification system that recognizes copyright protected content. If the system detects copyright protected material in a private upload, that content will be blocked.

### Your spoken word podcast was taken down for copyright infringement
If you’re using music in your podcast, please be sure that it’s fully cleared and not infringing on anyone’s rights.

In accordance with current copyright legislation, you can only upload tracks that you own the necessary licenses for. Purchasing a track to use it in your podcast does not automatically transfer rights to you to publicly publish the track in your podcast - neither in original nor in an edited way - without explicit permission. In order to be able to upload your podcast with the music in question to SoundCloud, you would need to get in touch with the original copyright holder. If you clear all content you use beforehand, you will avoid running into copyright infringement problems on the platform. Please also keep in mind that the SoundCloud Platform is available globally and that your licenses need to take account of that.

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original rights holders to use their material in your podcast on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

#### Where can I find music to use in my future podcasts, so I don't infringe on anyone's copyright?
##### Online sound libraries
You can find royalty free and podsafe tracks from online sound libraries. These sound libraries offer tracks that may be used for different purposes depending on the specific license. Whereas some may be only made available for private download, others may be used in published projects, and they would be a great choice for you to use as podcast introduction or transition music. If you find sounds you want to use from such libraries, please read their license terms to ensure that you can publish them on SoundCloud as part of your podcast. Please ensure the master recording as well as the publishing rights are covered in the license terms.

##### SoundCloud creators and Creative Commons
You can get permission directly from the creator(s) in the case that they retain all rights to their music. Since you’re already on SoundCloud, feel free to search for tracks you like from creators on the platform. Using the Creative Commons search filters can be helpful in finding available tracks, but we still recommend getting direct permission from the creator. You can reach out to creators directly via the messaging function and ask for their permission. If they aren’t the sole creator of the track or have assigned their rights to a recording company and/or to a publisher, please ensure that you get all the other rights holders’ permissions before using the content.

### Your radio show was taken down for copyright infringement

If your radio station has its own SoundCloud account and all necessary licenses covering master recordings rights and publishing rights for the specific use of their SoundCloud account, you might be able to upload your show to the radio station’s account.

When you would like to use SoundCloud to upload and stream a radio show that includes copyright protected music, there are a number of rights that need to be cleared before uploading your tracks to SoundCloud.

The following rights will need to be cleared:

* master recording rights for all the tracks that are used in your upload
* publishing rights for all the tracks that are used in your upload

Please be aware that in some cases multiple rights holders are involved in copyright ownership.

If you are able to provide proof that you do have permission from the original rights holders to use their material in your radio show on SoundCloud, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

### A track in the public domain was taken down for copyright infringement
The vast majority of the material that is publicly available on the internet for free is NOT in the public domain. If you want to create something new based on publicly available material, it is your responsibility to find out whether the material you want to use falls in the public domain before making use of it. It is absolutely essential that you verify this, even if you are using someone else’s material for promotional purposes only or if you are not making any profit from its use.

Works that are in the public domain either fell out of copyright protection or are not eligible for copyright protection - such as federal government works in the US territory - or were gifted to the public domain by their creators. This type of works can be used without requesting permission from their creators. For any other work that does not fall in the public domain, you will certainly need the permission from the copyright holder(s) to do so.

What’s important to bear in mind is that copyright protection can vary from country to country and that when a track is uploaded to your account, it is available everywhere in the world. You should therefore make sure that the material you want to use has fallen in the public domain globally.

If you are able to provide proof that the work you have uploaded on SoundCloud is globally available in the public domain, our Copyright Team is happy to manually review these permissions and reinstate the track onto your profile. Please sign into your account and fill out the disputes form here.

## Protecting my content on SoundCloud

### Protecting my content on SoundCloud

Building a platform that helps creators of music and audio share their original content is at the heart of everything we do at SoundCloud. From the outset, we wanted to build a diverse, collaborative community of creators, where the rights of creators are respected.

### Do I need to copyright my content?

Copyright is automatically granted to you when you begin creating your work. You don't have to file anything anywhere, or publish anything online to own the copyright of your music.
 
However, it gets tricky if you ever need to prove this. If there is ever a dispute over the ownership of your copyright, it can be very helpful to have some official documentation filed with the government to back up your claim of ownership. Some people do register their copyright with official organizations, because it can help prevent legal trouble in the future.

For information about copyright protection in your country, try your local copyright office.

 
Please note: This does not constitute legal advice and we would recommend you to seek legal guidance if you need more information on this subject.

### Creative Commons

#### What is Creative Commons?
Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that has drafted a set of free and voluntary copyright licenses that may be used by any creator for any of their content. With Creative Commons licenses, creators have the choice to give up certain exclusive rights normally associated with copyright, while retaining others. There are currently six different licenses that provide users with different levels of freedom.

#### When to apply a Creative Commons license to a track
Creative Commons licenses are designed for you to let other people know how they can use your tracks if you are the original creator and copyright owner of the content within your track. They also ensure that you will be recognized as the original creator of that content.

 Creative Commons licenses should not be used if you don’t have respective licenses or permissions in place for other people’s content included in your track. For example, if you create a mix or a mashup using someone else’s tracks, then a creative commons license does not apply here. They do not stand in place of permission from the original copyright holders.

#### How to apply a Creative Commons license to a track
After uploading a track or playlist, you can select which license you would like to release your piece of content under on SoundCloud. You can change the license via the track's Metadata tab in its edit page (hover over your track and click the pen icon below the waveform) like this:

### How do copyright strikes work?

If SoundCloud receives a third-party report that one of your tracks contains infringing content (i.e., copyright protected work that is copied or adapted), we’ll take down the reported track and contact you through an on-site notification and an email sent to the primary address listed on your account.

You are allowed to dispute a report and the instructions for doing so are here. If the claim is not successfully disputed within seven days of the report being made, you will be issued a strike.

Strikes are used to help communicate the importance of copyright, and to ensure rightful ownership and permissions of all content uploaded to the platform. Each successive strike penalizes you further, with the third strike resulting in a termination of your account. Below are the actions we take based on number of strikes.

* The first strike does not affect the functionality of your account but will make you ineligible for SoundCloud Premier monetization.
* The second strike results in a suspension of the download functionality on your account.
* In line with our Terms of Use, we have to permanently terminate accounts that have reached more than two active strikes. 

Strikes will expire 12 months from the date of issue. However, the reported track must remain blocked after a strike expires in compliance with copyright law, but any penalty will no longer be in effect. For example, if you have two strikes and one expires, the download functionality is restored.

You can find out if you have received a copyright strike in the last year by checking your email or in-product notifications. If you cannot access either, please contact copyrights@soundcloud.com for assistance.

### SoundCloud's Copyright policies

Building a platform that helps creators of music and audio share their original content is at the heart of everything we do at SoundCloud. From the outset, we wanted to build a diverse, collaborative community of creators, where their rights are respected.

### Copyright methods and notifications

We care about ensuring that artists and copyright owners have the tools they need to control how their work appears on SoundCloud. Reading further you will understand more about the tools we have in place today — both automated and manual — and how we are using these to look out for the rights of creators.

#### Automated content identification and manual takedowns on SoundCloud
SoundCloud has used automated content identification on SoundCloud since 2010. Here’s how it works: when you upload a track, our system checks your upload against a database of tracks that copyright owners have asked us to block. If the system detects a match, then your upload is blocked, because that’s what the copyright owner has asked us to do. We also run the system in the background to make sure that we’re picking up infringing content on an ongoing basis after upload. If the system detects a match, the track will be automatically removed.

In addition to the automated system, we have a manual takedown process. Manual takedowns happen when people submit a report directly using our webform, which can be found by clicking on the ‘Report Copyright Infringement’ button that appears on every track page. Anyone can report a copyright infringement if they are the relevant copyright owner or their authorized representative, and every report has the same result: the reported content is taken down from SoundCloud while the dispute is resolved. In some cases, copyright owners can takedown content from SoundCloud directly using a specific takedown tool. This tool has been available for several years, and provides the most effective means for copyright owners to takedown unauthorized content.

#### Copyright warnings and terminations
If we receive a valid notification from a third party in accordance with our reporting processes or applicable law that any of your content infringes the copyright, we will take the respective content down and send you a written notification to your registered email address asking you to clarify your rights by filing a dispute. If you do not successfully dispute the takedown - that is if you did not dispute the takedown after 7 days or if your dispute has been rejected -, we will send you a copyright warning to this effect via email and you will collect a strike to your account. Any user that receives more than two of these warnings is liable to have their access to the platform terminated forthwith.

Copyright owners are not able to terminate anyone’s account — only SoundCloud can do this, and we will do it if we receive repeated reports of infringement. Whether a copyright owner takes down content directly, or reports it to us for takedown, the result is the same: the content is taken down until the dispute can be resolved.

Important: SoundCloud has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the unauthorized publication of unreleased music. We will also suspend or terminate any account found liable of sharing unreleased copyright protected material.

We will also suspend or terminate your account without warning if ordered to do so by a court, and/or in other appropriate circumstances, as determined by SoundCloud at its discretion.

Please note: We do not offer refunds to Pro and Pro Unlimited account holders whose accounts are terminated as a result of repeated infringement of these Terms of Use or our Community Guidelines.

### How to avoid copyright infringement

How to avoid copyright infringement
Because the rights afforded by copyright law are exclusive to the copyright owner(s), you will infringe copyright if you make use of the copyrighted work without the permission of the copyright owner(s) - for example, if you copy or adapt a copyright work, or make it available on the internet.

The best way to avoid copyright infringement is to ensure that you don’t use anything created by someone else. Simple as that.

If you do use someone else's work, make sure you have the necessary permissions – this will usually take the form of a license from the copyright owner(s), which you may have to pay for. There are certain instances where you may be able to use excerpts of copyrighted material without a license – for example, if you use a small part of someone else's work for the purposes of criticism or review, or if your use constitutes "fair use" under applicable law (particularly U.S. law) – however, discussion of these exceptions is beyond the scope of this guidance. If you intend to use any part of a copyright work in reliance on any of the statutory exceptions, you should seek legal advice first.

If you have any doubt regarding the extent of your rights in any tracks, you should consult with a suitably qualified lawyer before uploading anything to SoundCloud or making any claims or counter-claims regarding your rights. However, as a general guide, here are some of the issues you might want to consider before uploading something to SoundCloud:

#### For uploads containing musical works:
Can you answer “yes” to all of the following questions?

* Did you compose the music yourself?
* Did you write the lyrics yourself?
* Did you record and produce the track yourself or do you have permission from the producer or record label that made the sound recording?
* Do you have written permission from all copyright owners to use any samples contained in the track? 

Can you answer “no” to all of the following questions?

* Were you signed to a record label when you recorded the track?
* Do you have a publishing deal?
* Are you a member of a performing rights organization or collecting society?
* Have you licensed your track to anyone else?
* Does the track contain the entirety or any part of someone else's song(s) Is it based on someone else’s song(s)?

#### For other tracks, including field recordings, podcasts, audiobooks or voice messages:

Can you answer “yes” to all of the following questions?

* Is the recording spontaneous, as opposed to being recited from a script, play or book (other than one written by you)?
* Is it a recording of your performance?
* Did you make the recording yourself?
* Do you have the permission of anyone else appearing in the recording to upload and share the recording on SoundCloud?

Can you answer “no” to all of the following questions?

* Is the recording rehearsed or recited from a script, play or book (other than one written by you)?
* Does the recording contain any music or excerpts from other copyright works (e.g. movie dialogue)?

#### What if I uploaded the track as private, isn't that okay? 
Even if it is for your own personal use, you won’t be allowed to upload a copyrighted track to your SoundCloud profile as a private track, as it is still possible to share private tracks to other listeners.

### Best practices for creating and uploading your own original content

Copyright is automatically granted to you when you begin creating your work. You don't have to file anything anywhere, or publish anything online to own the copyright of your music.

However, it gets tricky if you ever need to prove this. If there is ever a dispute over the ownership of your copyright, it can be very helpful to have some official documentation filed with the government to back up your claim of ownership. Some people do register their copyright with official organizations, because it can help prevent legal trouble in the future. If you are concerned about whether your own content has been infringed, please find more information about this here.

For information about copyright protection in your country, try your local copyright office.

Please note: This does not constitute legal advice and we would recommend you to seek legal guidance if you need more information on this subject.

### Best practices for creating and uploading a track composed with someone else

Everyone who worked on those tracks owns part of the copyright for them, and you'll need to have everyone's approval before you can upload them to SoundCloud.

If you have written the lyrics, you own the copyright to them. However, if you did not create the beat or instrumental backing track, then somebody else owns the copyright in that (and vice versa). You would need their explicit permission before uploading the track to your profile and the other party can request that its publication shall be blocked if you do not have their permission.

### Best practices for creating and uploading a DJ mix

If you use parts of a track in a modified way, such as in a DJ mix, please bear in mind that you must have permission to use all tracks that you have included.

All respective rights holders still own the copyrights to their track included in your DJ mix and, based on current copyright legislation, you will need their explicit permission to upload or publish your DJ mix on SoundCloud. Some producers and publishers are fine with others using their material, but some are not and do not want their works altered or distributed without their explicit consent.

### Best practices for creating and uploading a mashup

A mashup is a derivative work. If you created a derivative work based on sounds that you have downloaded or found from other sources online - you would always need that content’s creator’s permission to upload it to your account.

Please also bear in mind that crediting the original creator and mentioning that the track has been used for non-commercial purposes is not sufficient.  Since it's based on other creators' tracks, you'll need to make sure that the copyright owners of all the works you included in your mashup are fine with you using them in your upload to SoundCloud, even in their edited form.

### Best practices for creating and uploading a cover version

Based on current copyright legislation, you always need permissions or the appropriate licenses if you would like to cover a copyrighted song in public as is the case when publishing a track on SoundCloud. Permissions or licenses may be needed for both the composition rights and the sound recording rights, depending on whether you're using a part of an original sound recording or have provided the vocals and played all the instruments.

While some producers and publishers are fine with third parties using their material, some others are not and do not want their works used without explicit consent.

### Best practices for creating and uploading a remix

Since your remix is based on another creator's track, you'll need permission from the original creator and any relevant rights holder before you can upload and publish your remix on SoundCloud.

Important: Please bear in mind that the creator who created the track you wish to remix does not necessarily retain all their rights, especially if their music has been licensed to a recording company. In such a case, their permission alone is not sufficient. We would recommend to be extra careful and ensure that all relevant rights holders including the recording company have given their permission before uploading your remix to your account.

### Best practices for uploading someone else's track

Buying or downloading a track doesn’t necessarily give you the right to upload it to an online platform or to make it available to a wider audience. As you may know it is still possible to share private tracks with other listeners. Remember to only upload content, both publicly and privately, that you own the copyright to or that you have the necessary rights holder permission to make a copy of and publish online.

Also, crediting the original artists on their track does give you legal permission to post it online. You'll still need explicit permission from all relevant copyright owners before you can upload someone else’s track to your profile, use it in a DJ mix or create any kind of derivative work from it (such as a mashup, remix, etc).

Please note: Based on current copyright legislation, you can only upload content to your account that you own the copyrights for or have the appropriate licenses to upload and make it available online from all relevant copyright owners.

If you created a derivative work based on tracks that you have downloaded or found from other sources online - you would always need that content’s creator’s permission to upload it to your account. Please also bear in mind that crediting the original creator and mentioning that the track has been used for non-commercial purposes is not sufficient.

### Best practices for creating and uploading music in a podcast

If you’re using music in your podcast, please be sure that it’s fully cleared and not infringing on anyone’s rights. We have included some suggestions for how you can do this below.
 
#### Online sound libraries 
You can find royalty free and podsafe tracks from online sound libraries. These sound libraries offer tracks that may be used for different purposes depending on the specific license. Whereas some may be only made available for private download, others may be used in published projects, and they would be a great choice for you to use as podcast introduction or transition music. If you find sounds you want to use from such libraries, please read their license terms to ensure that you can publish them on SoundCloud as part of your podcast. Please ensure the master recording as well as the publishing rights are covered in the license terms.

#### SoundCloud creators and Creative Commons 
You can get permission directly from the creator(s) in the case that they retain all rights to their music. Since you’re already on SoundCloud, feel free to search for tracks you like from creators on the platform. Using the Creative Commons search filters can be helpful in finding available tracks, but we still recommend getting direct permission from the creator. You can reach out to creators directly via the messaging function and ask for their permission. If they aren’t the sole creator of the track or have assigned their rights to a recording company and/or a publisher, please ensure that you get all the other rights holders’ permissions before using the content.

Please do not use copyrighted content in your podcasts without rights holder permission. If you have the necessary licenses to all content you use beforehand, you will avoid running into copyright infringement problems on the platform. Please also keep in mind that the SoundCloud Platform is available globally and that your licenses need to take account of that.  Following the guidelines above can ensure that you have a smooth experience with podcasting on SoundCloud. Happy podcasting!

### Best practices for creating and uploading a radio show

In case you would like to use SoundCloud to upload and stream a track that includes copyright protected music, such as in a radio show, the following rights will need to be cleared before uploading your tracks to SoundCloud:

* Master recording rights for all the tracks that are used in your upload
* Publishing rights for all the tracks that are used in your upload

Please be aware that in some cases multiple rights holders are involved in copyright ownership, and you will have to get express permission from everyone before uploading to SoundCloud.

Your license(s) must cover, among other things, using, reproducing and distributing/making publicly available of the tracks you want to include in your upload on SoundCloud platform.

### Best practices for creating and uploading an entry for a remix contest or competition

Best practices for creating and uploading an entry for a remix contest or competition
There are a couple of things to keep in mind before uploading an entry for a competition or contest on the SoundCloud platform:

* If the competition is not being run on the SoundCloud Platform, it may be that the organizer of the competition has not acquired the correct permissions to have your remix available on SoundCloud for that purpose. 
* If you are participating in a DJ-mix contest, please bear in mind that you must have the necessary permissions to use all tracks that you have included in your DJ-mix.
* It's also possible that the rules of the competition state that entries must be removed from accounts once a competition finishes. So, if you don’t remove your remix in time after the competition finishes, it may be reported for copyright infringement.

Always be sure to read the rules of the contest before you submit your entry, and bear in mind that SoundCloud does not run any remix competitions on SoundCloud platform - we don’t make the rules!

### Best practices for uploading a bought or free track

Downloading a track (or purchasing it) does not transfer the right to you to upload or make it publicly available on SoundCloud. You'll still need permission from the copyright owner(s) if you want to make their music available on your profile, even if the copyright owner has made it available for free elsewhere.

How about checking if this creator has an official SoundCloud account? If the track is already published there, you can repost it to your own profile or add it to your Library.

### Best practices for uploading a track in the public domain

Best practices for uploading a track in the public domain
Let’s start by busting a myth. The vast majority of the material that is publicly available on the internet for free is NOT in the public domain. If you want to create something new based on publicly available material, it is your responsibility to find out whether the material you want to use falls in the public domain before making use of it. It is absolutely essential that you verify this, even if you are using someone else’s material for promotional purposes only or if you are not making any profit from its use.

Works that are in the public domain either fell out of copyright protection or are not eligible for copyright protection - such as federal government works in the US territory - or were gifted to the public domain by their creators. This type of works can be used without requesting permission from their creators. For any other work that does not fall in the public domain, you will certainly need the permission from the copyright holder(s) to do so.

What’s important to bear in mind is that copyright protection can vary from country to country and that when a track is uploaded to your account, it is available everywhere in the world. You should therefore make sure that the material you want to use has fallen in the public domain globally.

### Best practices for uploading a track under fair use

Fair use is a legal doctrine that primarily exists in the copyright law of the United States. Fair use limits the exclusive rights granted by copyright and allows the use of copyrighted material for certain limited purposes only, without requiring permission from the rights holder and depending on the exact use of the original work to be determined on a case by case basis.  Purposes recognized under fair use may be such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching and similar activities.    

However, uploading a track for non-commercial and promotional purposes to SoundCloud does not fall within the fair use exemption. Moreover, fair use is not recognised in every country. Keep in mind that SoundCloud is a global platform, we expect all our users to respect copyright on a worldwide basis.
