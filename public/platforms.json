Any credible threats to harm others\nwill be removed. We may also remove support for violent organizations.\nPromoting Self-Harm\nFacebook is not a place for self-destructive behavior. To that end we don't allow\nthe promotion of suicide, \"cutting,\" eating disorders, or illegal drug use. We take\nthreats of suicide very seriously and will contact the relevant authorities when we\nbecome aware of them.\nBullying & Harassment\nAs a community, we place a high value on respecting each other, and take reports\nof harassment very seriously. We take action when private individuals are bullied\nor persistently contacted against their wishes. While we encourage you to make\nmeaningful new connections, please keep in mind that contacting strangers or\npeople you've never met in person can be a form of harassment.\nHate Speech\nFacebook does not tolerate hate speech. Please grant each other mutual respect\nwhen you communicate here. While we encourage the discussion of ideas,\ninstitutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation of our terms to single out\nindividuals based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual\norientation, disability, or disease.\nGraphic Violence\nWhile we are a platform for sharing events that take place in your life and around\nthe world, any inappropriately graphic content will be removed when found on the\nsite. Sadistic displays of violence against people or animals, or depictions of sexual\nassault, are prohibited.\nSex & Nudity\nWe have a strict \"no nudity or pornography\" policy. Any content that is\ninappropriately sexual will be removed. Before posting questionable content, be\nmindful of the consequences for you and your environment.\nTheft, Vandalism, or Fraud\nWe are trying to make the world a more open, connected, and ultimately better\nplace. Organizing acts that harm others through theft, vandalism, or fraud is a\nviolation of our terms.\nIdentity & Privacy\nFacebook is a community where real people connect and share using their real\nidentities. When you represent yourself accurately on Facebook you are helping to\nbuild trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be someone else, creating multiple\naccounts, or falsely representing an organization undermines this trust and violates\nFacebook Community Standards\nFacebook is a global community where millions of people connect with each other. Each of these people represents\nunique opinions, ideals, and cultural values. Out of consideration for this diversity, we work to foster an environment\nwhere everyone can openly discuss issues and express their views, while respecting the rights of others.\nWhen millions of people get together to share things that are important to them, sometimes these discussions and posts\ninclude controversial topics and content. We believe this online dialog mirrors the exchange of ideas and opinions that\nhappens throughout people's lives offline, in conversations at home, at work, in cafes, and in classrooms.\nAs a trusted community of friends, family, coworkers, and classmates, Facebook is largely self-regulated. People who use\nFacebook can and do report content that they find questionable or offensive. To balance the needs and interests of a\nglobal community we ask everyone to respect the following content standards:\nEmail\nPassword\nLogin\nKeep me logged in\nForgot your password?\nour terms. Please also refrain from publishing other people's personal information.\nIntellectual Property\nBefore sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.\nWe ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.\nPhishing & Spam\nWe take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to\ncompromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by\nnot contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.\nReporting Abuse\nIf you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you can report it to us. Please keep in mind\nthat reporting a person, organization, or piece of content doesn't guarantee its removal from the site.\nBecause of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you\nwithout meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer personal controls over\nwhat you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, Pages, or applications that offend you.\nContent that does violate our terms may be removed from our site and (in some cases) subject to legal or other\naction.\nFacebook \u00a9 2011 \u00b7 English (US)\nMobile \u00b7 Find Friends \u00b7 Badges \u00b7 People \u00b7 Pages \u00b7 About \u00b7 Advertising \u00b7 Developers \u00b7 Careers \u00b7 Privacy \u00b7 Terms \u00b7 Help"

Repeatedly targeting other users with\nunwanted friend requests or messages is a form of harassment.\nHate Speech\nFacebook does not permit hate speech. While we encourage you to challenge\nideas, institutions, events, and practices, it is a serious violation to attack a person\nbased on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual\norientation, disability or medical condition.\nGraphic Content\nPeople use Facebook to share events through photos and videos. We understand\nthat graphic imagery is a regular component of current events, but must balance\nthe needs of a diverse community. Sharing any graphic content for sadistic\npleasure is prohibited.\nNudity and Pornography\nFacebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and\nimposes limitations on the display of nudity. At the same time, we aspire to respect\npeople\u2019s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos\nof a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.\nIdentity and Privacy\nOn Facebook people connect and share using their real identities. This culture\ncreates accountability and builds trust and safety for everyone. Claiming to be\nanother person, creating multiple accounts, or falsely representing an organization\nundermines community and violates Facebook\u2019s terms. Finally, you may not publish\nother people's personal information.\nIntellectual Property\nBefore sharing content on Facebook, please be sure you have the right to do so.\nFacebook Community Standards\nFacebook gives people around the world the power to publish their own stories, see the world through the eyes of many\nother people, and connect and share wherever they go. The conversation that happens on Facebook \u2013 and the opinions\nexpressed here \u2013 mirror the diversity of the people using Facebook. \nTo balance the needs and interests of a global population, Facebook protects expression that meets the community\nstandards outlined on this page. \nPlease review these standards. They will help you understand what type of expression is acceptable, and what type of\ncontent may be reported and removed.\nEmail or Phone\nPassword\nLog In\nKeep me logged in\nForgot your password?\nSign Up\nFacebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.\nWe ask that you respect copyrights, trademarks, and other legal rights.\nPhishing and Spam\nWe take the safety of our members seriously and work to prevent attempts to\ncompromise their privacy or security. We also ask that you respect our members by\nnot contacting them for commercial purposes without their consent.\nReporting Abuse\nIf you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us.

In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13\nwithout verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might\nhave any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at info@facebook.com.\nChildren Between the Ages of 13 and 18\nWe recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about\nthemselves to anyone over the Internet.\nUse of Information Obtained by Facebook\nWhen you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as\nyour name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to\nconnect with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications\nregarding new services offered by Facebook that we think you may find valuable.\nProfile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service\nand to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings. In some cases where your\nprivacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement your profile.\nProfile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the\nnetworks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).\nYour name, school name, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network\nunless you alter your privacy settings. This is primarily so your friends at other schools can find you and send a friend\nrequest. People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they\nhave a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your school's network, etc.) that allows such access based\non your privacy settings.\nFacebook will send you only service-related announcements from time to time through the general operation of the\nservice. For instance, if a friend sends you a new message or poke, or someone posts on your wall, you may receive an\nemail alerting you to that fact.\nGenerally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to\nreceive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.\nFacebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for\npurposes such as aggregating how many people at a school like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and\npromotions so that we can provide you Facebook. We believe this benefits you. You can know more about the world\naround you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you. For example, if you put a\nfavorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town.\nBut we don't tell the movie company who you are.\nWe may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and\nInternet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services and other users of Facebook, to supplement your profile.\nWhere such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be\ndone or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).\nSharing Your Information with Third Parties\nWe do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. We share your information with\nthird parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service,\n2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you. For example:\nWe may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may\nuse third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send\nout email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for\nproducts or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links). In connection with these\nofferings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use\nfor a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties for the processing of\nany personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that\ninformation to the Facebook-specified purposes.\nWe occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world. Such\naccounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit\npossible misuse.\nWe may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders,\nor in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an\ninformation request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may\nshare account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or\nproperty, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the\nFacebook name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies,\nlawyers, agents or government agencies.\nWe let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored\ngroups or other on-site offers.\nWe may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook. You can tell when another\ncompany is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with\nthat company in connection with your use of that store or service.\nIf the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by\nFacebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can\ncontinue operations. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the\npromises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.\nLinks\nFacebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web\nsites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every\nweb site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by\nFacebook.\nThird Party Advertising\nAdvertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or \"served\") directly to users by third party\nadvertisers. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also\ndownload cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and \"web beacons\" (also known as \"1x1\ngifs\") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising\nnetwork to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of\ntheir ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using\nyour computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not\nhave access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers. Third party advertisers have\nno access to your contact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them. \nThis privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking\ntechnologies by any of its advertisers.\nChanging or Removing Information\nAccess and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.\nFacebook users may modify or remove any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account.\nInformation will be updated immediately. Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the My\nPrivacy page. Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally\navailable to members of Facebook. \nWhere you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on\nFacebook, however, (e.g., posting on someone else's Wall) you generally cannot remove such communications.\nSecurity\nFacebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a\nsecured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we\nrequest that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions\nabout the security of Facebook Web Site, please contact us at privacy@facebook.com.\nTerms of Use, Notices and Revisions\nIf you choose to visit Facebook, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of\nUse, including limitations on damages, arbitration of, and application of law of the state of California. We reserve the right\nto change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect\nimmediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will\npost them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this\npolicy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current\nprivacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.\nContacting the Web Site\nIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@facebook.com.\nabout jobs advertise press terms privacy\na Mark Zuckerberg production\nFacebook \u00a9 2006"

If you want to express your excitement over a beautiful photo, it\u2019s best to double\ntap on the image to like it!\n\nDo share photos that are safe for people of all ages.\n\nRemember that our community is a diverse one, and that your photos are visible to people as young as 13 years\nold. While we respect the artistic integrity of photos, we have to keep our product and the photos within it in line\nwith our App Store\u2019s rating for nudity and mature content. In other words, please do not post nudity or mature\ncontent of any kind.\n\nDo treat others as you would like to be treated.\n\nPeople from around the world with different backgrounds come together to share images on Instagram, which is\ngreat, but it also means that not everyone will agree with what you think or believe. We ask that all users be polite\nand respectful in their interactions with other members.\n\nDo have meaningful & genuine interactions.\n\nSelf-promotion or commercial solicitation of any kind, in any form, is rarely well-received. Users often notice when\nyou have posted the same comment elsewhere or have followed a large number of users to gain followers in\nreturn, so please be sincere with your exchanges on Instagram.\n\nDo have fun!\n\nInstagram is the best way to quickly share beautiful photographs of your life with others, and see the world through\nothers\u2019 eyes. It\u2019s photo sharing reinvented, so have fun!\nWhat not to do:\nIt is important to note that overstepping the boundaries outlined below may result in a disabled account, or discontinued\naccess to Instagram, without warning.\n\nDon\u2019t share photos that aren\u2019t yours.\n\nThis includes other people\u2019s photos, and/or things that you have copied or collected from the Internet. Accounts\nthat solely consist of only this type of content may be disabled at any time.\n\nDon\u2019t share photos that show nudity or mature content.\n\nIf you wouldn\u2019t show the photo you are thinking about uploading to a child, or your boss, or your parents, you\nprobably shouldn\u2019t share it on Instagram. The same rule applies to your profile photo. Accounts found sharing\nnudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued.\n\nDon\u2019t share photos of illegal content.\n\nIf we find you sharing prohibited or illegal content, including photographs of extreme violence or gore, your account\nmay be disabled and we will take appropriate action, which may include reporting you to the authorities.\n\nDon\u2019t spam.\n\nInstagram is a place where people can share beautiful photos of their lives, and when you engage in self-\npromotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that moment with you feel sad\ninside. This guideline includes repetitive comments, as well as service manipulation in order to self-promote, and\nextends to commercial spam comments, such as discount codes or URLs to websites. We ask that you keep your\ninteractions on Instagram meaningful and genuine.\n\nDon\u2019t be rude.\n\nInstagram is a friendly place where everyone should feel safe and comfortable sharing their lives through\nphotographs. It is not an appropriate place to abuse, attack, harass, or impersonate others. If we receive valid\ncomplaints about your conduct, we\u2019ll send a warning or disable your account. Alternatively, we\u2019d recommend\nusers block all meanies & trolls to prevent further issues.\n\nDon't promote or glorify self-harm.\n\nWhile Instagram is a place where people can share their lives with others through photographs, any account found\nencouraging or urging users to embrace anorexia, bulimia, or other eating disorders; or to cut, harm themselves, or\ncommit suicide will result in a disabled account without warning. We believe that communication regarding these\nbehaviors in order to create awareness, come together for support and to facilitate recovery is important, but that\nInstagram is not the place for active promotion or glorification of self-harm.\nAdditional things to remember\nInstagram is a diverse community, and it is likely that you will come across things that offend you. If you are\noffended by a photo that may not violate any of the above guidelines, we\u2019d suggest you navigate away from the\naccount, or even use our blocking feature. If you are unsure about the content, you can report it utilizing our built-in\nreporting functionality in order to bring it to the Instagram Team\u2019s attention.\nIf you find that one of your images has been uploaded to another user\u2019s profile, try not to panic. It is likely a\nmisunderstanding and not ill-intended. A good first step is to comment on the image & politely ask that they take\nthe content down. If that doesn\u2019t work, please file a DMCA report so that we may investigate.\nYou might find yourself wanting to post a screenshot of the offending account to your photo-stream in order to draw\nattention to the situation or user, but that\u2019s often not the best way to go about resolving the issue. We do not\nencourage singling out the user, as it may be classified as harassment, which violates our guidelines.\nIf you think that there is immediate cause for concern, you can send a report to the Instagram Team. Please\nprovide all necessary information for us to quickly respond to an issue that urgently needs our attention, this\nincludes image descriptions & dates, URLs, and valid usernames.\nIf you believe you will have trouble following these guidelines we\u2019d suggest finding an alternative photo sharing service, as\nInstagram may not be the best place for you.

      , "mdNew": "Community Guidelines\nThe Short\nWe want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression. Help us foster this\ncommunity. Post only your own photos and videos and always follow the law. Respect everyone on Instagram, don\u2019t spam\npeople or post nudity.\nThe Long\nInstagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about the\ndifferent points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.\nWe created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community. By using Instagram,\nyou agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use. We\u2019re committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too.\nOverstepping these boundaries may result in a disabled account.\nShare only photos and videos that you\u2019ve taken or have the right to share.\nAs always, you own the content you post on Instagram. Remember to post authentic content, and don\u2019t post\nanything you\u2019ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don\u2019t have the right to post. Learn more\nabout intellectual property rights.\nPost photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.\nWe know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature,\nbut for a variety of reasons, we don\u2019t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-\ncreated content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some\nphotos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed.\nNudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.\nPeople like to share photos or videos of their children. For safety reasons, there are times when we may remove\nimages that show nude or partially-nude children. Even when this content is shared with good intentions, it could\nbe used by others in unanticipated ways. You can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.\nFoster meaningful and genuine interactions.\nHelp us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or\ncontent, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent.\nFollow the law.\nInstagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups. Offering sexual services,\nbuying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if it\u2019s legal in your region), as well as promoting recreational\ndrug use is also not allowed. Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy regulated goods,\nincluding firearms, alcohol, and tobacco. You can learn more on our Regulated Goods and Services page.\nWe have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate\nimages of others.\nRespect other members of the Instagram community.\nWe want to foster a positive, diverse community. We remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech,\ncontent that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or\nharass someone, and repeated unwanted messages. We do generally allow stronger conversation around people\nwho are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.\nIt's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender,\ngender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases. When hate speech is being shared\nto challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it. In those instances, we ask that you express your intent\nclearly.\nSerious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed. This includes specific threats of physical harm\nas well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm. We carefully review reports of threats and consider\nmany things when determining whether a threat is credible.\nMaintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.\nThe Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as\neating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support. We try to\ndo our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the Help Center so people can get the help\nthey need.\nEncouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and we\u2019ll remove it\nor disable accounts if it\u2019s reported to us. To protect people, we may also remove content identifying victims or\nsurvivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.\nBe thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.\nWe understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events. Some of these issues\ncan involve graphic images. Because so many different people and age groups use Instagram, we may remove\nvideos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays appropriate for everyone.\nWe understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn or raise awareness. If you do share content\nfor these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence. Sharing graphic\nimages for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.\nHelp us keep the community strong:\nEach of us is an important part of the Instagram community. If you see something that you think may violate our\nguidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option. We have a global team that reviews these reports\nand works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn\u2019t meet our guidelines. Even if you or someone you\nknow doesn\u2019t have an Instagram account, you can still file a report. When you complete the report, try to provide as\nmuch information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review\nthe content quickly.\nYou may find content you don\u2019t like, but doesn\u2019t violate the community guidelines. If that happens, you\ncan unfollow or block the person who posted it, and if there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your\nposts, you can delete that comment.\nMany disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community. If one of your\nphotos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to\ntake it down. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can always file a copyright report so we can investigate. Or, if you believe\nsomeone is violating your trademark, you can file a trademark report. Don't target the person who posted it by\nposting screenshots and drawing attention to the situation because that may be classified as harassment.\nTo help keep the community safe, there are times when we work with law enforcement including when we believe\nthat there\u2019s risk of physical harm or threat to public safety.\nFor more information, check out our Help Center and Terms of Use.\nThank you for helping us create one of the best communities in the world,\nThe Instagram Team"

It is Instagram\u2019s\npolicy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.\nWebsite Visitors\nLike most website operators, Instagram collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers\ntypically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor\nrequest. Instagram\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Instagram\u2019s visitors\nuse its website. From time to time, Instagram may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by\npublishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\nInstagram also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for\nusers leaving comments on Instagram posts. Instagram only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the\nsame circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter\nIP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.\nGathering of Personally-Identifying Information\nCertain visitors to Instagram\u2019s websites choose to interact with Instagram in ways that require Instagram to gather personally-\nidentifying information. The amount and type of information that Instagram gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For\nexample, we ask visitors who sign up for an account on http://instagram.com to provide a username and email address. In each\ncase, Instagram collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction\nwith Instagram. Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can\nalways refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain\nwebsite-related activities.\nAggregated Statistics\nInstagram may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Instagram may display this information publicly or\nprovide it to others. However, Instagram does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nProtection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information\nInstagram discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,\ncontractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Instagram\u2019s behalf or to\nprovide services available at Instagram\u2019s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,\ncontractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Instagram\u2019s websites, you consent\nto the transfer of such information to them. Instagram will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying\ninformation to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Instagram\ndiscloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when\nInstagram believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Instagram, third parties\nor the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Instagram website and have supplied your email address, Instagram may\noccasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going\non with Instagram and our products.

For example, when you post on Facebook, you\nselect the audience for the post, such as a group, all of your friends, the public,\nor a customized list of people. Similarly, when you use Messenger or Instagram\nto communicate with people or businesses, those people and businesses can\nsee the content you send.

Public\ninformation can also be seen, accessed, reshared or downloaded through\nthird-party services such as search engines, APIs, and offline media such as\nTV, and by apps, websites and other services that integrate with our Products.\nLearn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on\nFacebook and Instagram.\nContent others share or reshare about you\nYou should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can\nsee your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off\nour Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you\nshared with. For example, when you share a post or send a message to\nspecific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that\ncontent to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality\nexperiences such as Facebook Spaces. Also, when you comment on someone\nelse's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to\nanyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change\nthe audience later.\nPeople can also use our Products to create and share content about you with\nthe audience they choose.

For example, we will remove developers'\naccess to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in\n3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will\nreduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only\nname, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.\nRequesting any other data will require our approval.\nNew owner.\nIf the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes,\nwe may transfer your information to the new owner.\nSharing with Third-Party Partners\nWe work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our\nProducts or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses,\nwhich makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to\npeople around the world.

Here are the types of third parties we share\ninformation with:\nPartners who use our analytics services.\nWe provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses\nunderstand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos\nand other content on and off the Facebook Products.

For example, we provide general demographic and interest\ninformation to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman\nbetween the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software\nengineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm\nwhich Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an\nadvertiser.\nMeasurement partners.\nWe share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide\nanalytics and measurement reports to our partners.\nPartners offering goods and services in our Products.\nWhen you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a\nseller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public\ninformation and other information you share with them, as well as the\ninformation needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact\ndetails.\nVendors and service providers.\nWe provide information and content to vendors and service providers who\nsupport our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services,\nanalyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating\npayments or conducting surveys.\nResearchers and academics.\nWe also provide information and content to research partners and academics\nto conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our\nbusiness or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of\ngeneral social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and\nwell-being.\nLaw enforcement or legal requests.\nWe share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in\nthe circumstances outlined below.\nLearn more about how you can control the information about you that you or\nothers share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram\nSettings.\nIV. How do the Facebook Companies work together?\nFacebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other\nFacebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative,\nrelevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.\nWe also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these\npurposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.\nFor example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its\nservice so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram\nor Messenger. We also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook\nCompany Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different\nFacebook Company Products.\nV. How can I manage or delete information about me?\nWe provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in\nyour Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.\nWe store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook\nProducts, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case\ndetermination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and\nprocessed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, when you\nsearch for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your\nsearch history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months. If you submit\na copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy\n30 days after submission. Learn more about deletion of content you have shared and\ncookie data obtained through social plugins.\nWhen you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and\nstatus updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. Information that\nothers have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. If you don't\nwant to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can\ndeactivate your account instead. To delete your account at any time, please visit the\nFacebook Settings and Instagram Settings.\nVI.

If we fail\nto enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.\nWe reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.\nWho Has Rights Under this Agreement.\nThis agreement does not give rights to any third parties.\nYou cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.\nOur rights and obligations can be assigned to others.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO\nDISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nWe also don\u2019t control what people and others do or say, and we aren\u2019t responsible for\ntheir (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful\nor objectionable content).

You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of\nany claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any\nmatter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim\nwithout our prior written consent.\nHow We Will Handle Disputes.\nExcept as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or\ndispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or Instagram\n(\"claim(s)\") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and\nclass arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own\nbehalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Instagram users. If there is a final\njudicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be\narbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that\nrequest for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain\nsubject to this provision.\nInstead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local \"small claims\" court,\nif the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if\nyou or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the\nclaims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration\nAssociation will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and\nwe expressly waive a trial by jury. \nThe following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes\nrelated to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform\nPolicy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized\nways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and\nenforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. \nThis arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. \nYou can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these\nTerms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email\naddress or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement that\nyou want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:\nFacebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park, CA\n94025.\nBefore you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of\nDispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone\nnumber you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the\nrelief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Facebook, Inc.,\nATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA 94025. Before we\ncommence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use\nwith your Instagram account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a\ndispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may\ncommence arbitration.\nWe will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees\nfor any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely\nprovided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of\narbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including\nrules regarding frivolous or improper claims.\nFor any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will\nbe resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a\nstate court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal\njurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.\nThe laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with\nfederal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law\nprovisions.\nUnsolicited Material.\nWe always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any\nrestrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep\nthem confidential.\nUpdating These Terms\nWe may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these\nTerms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required\nby law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to\nthese Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if\nyou continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want\nto agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here.\nRevised: April 19, 2018\nABOUT US\nHELP\nAPI\nJOBS\nBLOG TERMS\nPRIVACY\n\u00a9 2018 INSTAGRAM, INC.\nENGLISH (US)\nESPA\u00d1OL\nFRAN\u00c7AIS (FRANCE)\n\u4e2d\u6587(\u7b80\u4f53)\u0627\ufedf\ufecc\u0631\ufe91\ufbfe\ufe94\nPORTUGU\u00caS (BRASIL)\nITALIANO\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nDEUTSCH\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"

Technologies like artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service.\nHow can we help?\nHelp Center\nAutomated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our\nService.\nProviding consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook\nCompany Products.\nInstagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems,\ninsights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in\nthe Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure.\nWe also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you\nuse, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across\nthe Facebook Company Products.\nEnsuring access to our Service.\nTo operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems\naround the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this\nglobal infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This\ninfrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland\nLimited, or their affiliates.\nConnecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.\nWe use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as\nfrom third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that\nwe believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as\nall your other experiences on Instagram.\nResearch and innovation.\nWe use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on\nresearch to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our\ncommunity.\nHow Our Service Is Funded\nInstead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you\nacknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to\npromote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such\nas information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to\nyou.\nWe show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don\u2019t sell\nyour personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the\nkind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be\ninterested.\nWe also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them\nunderstand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For\nexample, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help\nthem better understand their audience. We don\u2019t share information that directly identifies\nyou (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact\nyou or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about\nhow Instagram ads work here.\nYou may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote\nproducts or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner\nmentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.\nThe Data Policy\nProviding our Service requires collecting and using your information.

It also\nexplains the many ways you can control your information, including in the Instagram\nPrivacy and Security Settings.

For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to\nthe Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement,\nthose other terms will govern.\nIf any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.\nAny amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If\nwe fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.\nWe reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.\nWho Has Rights Under this Agreement.\nOur past, present, and future affiliates and agents, including Instagram LLC, can\ninvoke our rights under this agreement in the event they become involved in a\ndispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.\nYou cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our\nconsent.\nOur rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if\nour ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.\nWho Is Responsible if Something Happens.\nOur Service is provided \"as is,\" and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or\nwill work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO\nDISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nWe also don\u2019t control what people and others do or say, and we aren\u2019t responsible\nfor their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including\nunlawful or objectionable content). We also aren\u2019t responsible for services and\nfeatures offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our\nService.\nOur responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called \"liability\") is\nlimited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't\nknow what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible\n(\"liable\") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,\nindirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these\nTerms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,\ninformation, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these\nTerms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past\ntwelve months.\nYou agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and\nagainst any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without\nlimitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way\nconnected with these Terms or your use of the Service.

We reserve the right to assume the\nexclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and\nyou will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.\nHow We Will Handle Disputes.\nExcept as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal\nclaim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms\nor Instagram (\"claim(s)\") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual\nbasis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may\nbring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other\nInstagram users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a\nrequest for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's\nlimitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.\nAll other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.\nInstead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local \"small claims\"\ncourt, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims\ncourt (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general\njurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The\nAmerican Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer\nArbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.\nThe following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court:\ndisputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of\nour Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service\nin unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to\nthe scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.\nThis arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these\nTerms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email\naddress or phone number you use for your Instagram account, and a clear statement\nthat you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:\nFacebook, Inc. ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Opt-out, 1601 Willow Rd., Menlo Park,\nCA 94025.\nBefore you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written\nNotice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username, email\naddress or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description\nof the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should\nbe mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.\nMenlo Park, CA 94025. Before we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice\nof Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other\nappropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after\nthe Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.\nWe will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator\nfees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you\ntimely provided us with a Notice of Dispute. For all other claims, the costs and fees of\narbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,\nincluding rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.\nFor any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it\nwill be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to\nthe personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such\nclaim.\nThe laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with\nfederal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law\nprovisions.\nUnsolicited Material.\nWe always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them\nwithout any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are\nunder no obligation to keep them confidential.\nUpdating These Terms\nWe may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these\nTerms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required\nby law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to\nthese Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if\nyou continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want\nto agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, here. \nRevised: December 20, 2020\nABOUT US\nHELP\nAPI\nJOBS\nTERMS\nPRIVACY\n\u00a9 2020 INSTAGRAM, INC.\nENGLISH (US)\nESPA\u00d1OL\nFRAN\u00c7AIS (FRANCE)\n\u4e2d\u6587(\u7b80\u4f53)\u0627\ufedf\ufecc\u0631\ufe91\ufbfe\ufe94\nPORTUGU\u00caS (BRASIL)\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nITALIANO\nDEUTSCH\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"
