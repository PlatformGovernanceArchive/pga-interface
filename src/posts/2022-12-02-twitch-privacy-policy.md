# Twitch enhances the treatment of user-provided information

Twitch has [elaborated the scope of legal obligations and user data treatment](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/69f34bdcb4edc037315f12b2f157e117754275fa). In particular, the revisited policy states that the users’ agreement to allow the defined treatment of data will be **documented**. It is also now stated that upon registration to the platform and upon interaction with platforms services and features, users provide an **extensive list of personal information**, including voice, image, billing information, address and phone number.

As per the legal obligations: conditions, such as “monitoring and analysing the use of Twitch services,” “investigating and defending ourselves against third-party claims” are now considered by Twitch as **sufficient grounds for documenting users’ consent**. The revisited terms apply to all Twitch Interactive, Inc. applications and services.
