# Instagram shortens the allowed inactivity period for developers

Instagram [changed](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/8382111323ecfa8120c8fcdcad959040fa6cc994) the inactivity period for developer accounts, after which it will **suspend or end access** to the platform’s APIs and other functions “with or without notice.” The inactivity period has now been reduced **from 90 to 28 days**. 

One of the reasons for the shortening of the allowed inactivity might be due to [Meta’s ongoing measures for privacy and security](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2019/04/25/api-updates/), which include regular re-evaluation of policies and data access. In case of data access expiry due to inactivity, developers are able to **file for an app-review to regain access**.

Instagram’s Graph, Messenger and Basic Display APIs allow users access data for professional and non-professional accounts to reach a wider Instagram audience.
