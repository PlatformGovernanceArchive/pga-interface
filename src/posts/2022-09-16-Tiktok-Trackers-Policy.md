# TikTok updates the list of third-party tracking companies

TikTok [added](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/c00421c1336b811cf5a0d87336a4aeb8c3e2cbe6) a new third party for its tracking processes. The company explains the addition by the **importance to improve marketing campaigns, optimize company ad presence and remarket to existing users**.

Previously, [the policy](https://www.tiktok.com/legal/tiktok-website-cookies-policy?lang=en) already included tracker pixels (an HTML code that is used for tracking user behavior) of Bing and Facebook, in addition to LinkedIn Insight Tag, Google Analytics, and AppsFlyer â€“ all used for the same purpose, with a duration of 24 months.  

According to [recent research](https://app.urlgeni.us/blog/new-research-across-200-ios-apps-hints-surveillance-marketing-may-still-be-going-strong) of 200 iOS apps, such an addition is yet another contribution to TikTok being the company that uses data tracking and sending it to third parties more than any other social media app.
