# LinkedIn increases user transparency in regards to its Trackers Policy

In the first quarter of 2022, LinkedIn [updated](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-versions/commit/139f902b972bdd1856ce3f446efb26c1a0dfec33) its Trackers Policy. The company added more examples of tracking devices such as pixels and local storage, while also emphasising that the names of “cookies and similar technologies may change over time”. 

The update **provided LinkedIn's users with more insight into the different types of tracking** as well as when and why they are implemented. Examples given are verification processes, security features, selection of a preferred language, and customised content. Moreover, **users get informed where exactly they can manage their cookie preferences** on the website. This update was executed, as stated at the beginning of the policy, “in the spirit of transparency”.

The need for transparency about the usage of cookies can be traced back to privacy laws in the European Union which require platforms to inform EU visitors about cookies used on their website. According to [CookieLaw](https://www.cookielaw.org/the-cookie-law/), the law “was designed to protect online privacy, by making consumers aware of how information about them is collected and used online, and give them a choice to allow it or not”.
