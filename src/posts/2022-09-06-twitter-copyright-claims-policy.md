# Twitter characterises cases of multiple copyright infringements

In the third quarter of 2022, Twitter's [Copyright Claims Policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/copyright-policy) was [supplemented](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/e3d40443409007053d0105d25959233d05cdf397%20) with additional information about accounts with multiple copyright infringements. In the update, the company classified the type of actions that fall under this section.

Multiple copyright infringement include cases in which users re-post material which had already been removed in response to a prior copyright complaint, as well as instances where users (repeatedly) provide access to copyrighted material on third-party websites, and any other cases which suggest that an account seems to solely be used to infringe copyrighted material of others. The consequence for multiple copyright infringements can lead, according to Twitter, to a permanent account suspension. Such permanent bans can be appealed by the respective user.
This update displays the relevance of the general issue of copyright on social media platforms. Most companies are concerned with ways to handle copyright infringements on their online platforms, especially because of the [regulatory framework](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/copyright-legislation) in the European Union which seeks to warrant the protection of authors, performers, artists, and right holders (as stated by the [European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/copyright)).
