# Twitter specifies the limits of location sharing and sets off public debate about free speech
Just before the end of 2022, Twitter made a change in their[ Private information and media policy](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information), providing [additional information](https://github.com/OpenTermsArchive/pga-versions/commit/d834fc007b6da686ff920ad20bb82f10b0539526) on live location sharing. The update specified the platform's intention to not only protect private information, but specifically **live** **information and location**.

The company defines live information as “real-time and/or same-day information where there is potential that the individual could still be at the named location”. This could be revelations about someone's travel route, actual physical location, or “other identifying information that would reveal the person's location”. Tweets sharing such details will, according to Twitter, be removed **unless it is shared during a crisis situation or in relation to public engagement events**. The policy clarifies that accounts which are specifically dedicated to sharing live locations of other people will be suspended.

Interestingly, this update is connected to a public debate involving Twitter CEO Elon Musk. The platform's recent owner[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603181423787380737) about this policy change on the same day, stating “Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation”. According to reports by[ HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/twitter-roasts-elon-musk-for-posting-his-location-at-the-world-cup_n_639f5090e4b0aeb2ace4e956) and[ MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-told-journalists-you-dox-you-get-suspended-on-twitter-spaces-and-then-the-group-chat-feature-went-dark-11671214100), **the change of policy caused several journalists from the Washington Post, New York Times and CNN to be suspended from the platform**, as they wrote articles about the now banned account @ElonJet which tracked all the flights Musk travelled with his private jet in 2022, using publicly available data.

Reportedly, this caused BuzzFeed News tech writer Katie Notopoulos to open up a hTwitter space audio discussion about the suspensions. Musk himself joined the Space on the evening of December 15, saying “You dox, you get suspended. End of story. That’s it.” However, the suspended journalists claimed that they just implemented a “routine journalistic practice”. Regarding the public dispute, the Washington post[ tweeted](https://twitter.com/WashPostPR/status/1603592735973425152?s=20&t=y72FTYH9kQFiyIAiyAiAKw) that the suspension of its reporter’s account “directly undermines Elon Musk’s claim that he intends to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech.” What is further interesting is that the Private information and media policy does not apply to tweets in which the subject of the media is a public figure. The suspension of the journalists' accounts is thus debatable. According to[ Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11548409/You-dox-suspended-End-story-Elon-Musk-abruptly-hangs-journalists.html), **on January 16, the journalists' accounts were restored** due to the public backlash Elon Musk received.
