export const About_Intro_One = `The Platform Governance Archive (PGA) is a project to facilitate critical engagement with the way platforms order and govern our communication and activities. It offers an interactive exploration of major platforms’ set of rules, as well as access to a curated and structured database containing the key policies of the platforms’ full life-time. While public debates over e.g. the handling of misinformation and hate speech by major platforms have long reached mainstream audiences and policymakers, there is little accessible material to rigorously study the short- and long-term developments of companies’ internal policies. The PGA team at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society has collected and curated a vast collection of thousands of these documents, ranging from Terms of Service (ToS) to Community Guidelines.

The PGA proudly joins the ranks of a set of similarly spirited initiatives such as the  [*Princeton-Leuven Longitudinal Corpus of Privacy Policies*](https://privacypolicies.cs.princeton.edu//) and the [*Open Terms Archive*](https://disinfo.quaidorsay.fr/en/open-terms-archive). What sets the PGA apart from these projects are 1) our focus on substantial content policies of platforms (that is, we include not only the legalistic terms of service and privacy policies, but also the much more substantial community guidelines) and 2) a combination of automated and manual collection processes that has allowed us to identify when exactly actual changes to the policies occurred.

The project is inspired by Kirsten Gollatz’ pioneering work on the longitudinal collection and analysis of platform policies in her dissertation [“Die private Governance der Plattformen zur Regelung grenzüberschreitender Kommunikation”](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/188820/) at the University of Zurich.`;

export const About_Funding_Headline = 'Funding';
export const About_Funding_Text = `This is a project hosted and sustained by the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society (HIIG). The research and data collection part has substantially benefited from funding by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme as part of the [*ReCreating Europe*](https://www.hiig.de/en/project/platform-governance-and-copyright/) consortium (Grant Agreement Number 870626). The [*Open Science Fellowship*](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/Platform_Governance_Archives) offered by Wikimedia Deutschland to João Carlos Magalhães was vital for the launch of the PGA by enabling concept building and data cleaning.`;

//Data and Research
export const DataAndResearch_Intro_Headline = 'Data and Research';
export const DataAndResearch_Intro_Text = `Data for this project has been collected by a combination of automated and manual approaches. For the historical data, the process builds mostly on the [Internet Archive’s](https://archive.org/) [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). For the automated scraping of policy documents from Wayback Machine we have built a list of URLs where platforms publish their policies. These URLs have often changed over time, so the reconstruction of the full life-time of one policy document (eg. Facebook’s Community Guidelines) typically includes more than one URL. From these URLs, we scraped weekly snapshots that were saved to the raw version of the archive. To identify when actual changes within this corpus of raw data occured, we used a combination of automated and manual data filtering and diffchecking approaches. 

The curated version of the PGA is based on the principle that “We detect a new version of a policy, if at least one word in the policy text changes”. This word-based approach excludes changes to the formatting and layout of the policy text, as well as changes to other site elements, such as the header, footer and sidebar elements. We furthermore excluded typo corrections and changes to the companies’ contact information (such as their street or email address) from counting as new policy versions.

We have collected data for ten major platforms and four different document types (terms of service, community guidelines, privacy policies, copyright policies). With this first release, we are starting with Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Instagram – and will extend this collection in the weeks and months ahead.

It's essential to remember that, given the limitations of the WayBack Machine and of companies' websites, not to mention eventual human mistakes in the collection and cleaning of the data, we do not claim our database is necessarily complete. Take that into consideration when reading and writing about the documents we compiled here. And let us know if you spot any issue, inconsistency or gap in our collection.`;
