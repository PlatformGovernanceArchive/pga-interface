export const Intro_About_Text = 'The Platform Governance Archive (PGA) is a structured and open database with content policies of key platforms over their full life-time. While public debates over the handling of misinformation and hate speech by major platforms have long reached mainstream audiences and policy-makers, there is little accessible material to rigidly study short- and long-term developments of companies’ internal policies. The [Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society](https://www.hiig.de/en) has built up and curated a vast collection of thousands of these documents, ranging from Terms of Service (ToS)  to community guidelines  On this basis, the PGA enables researchers and journalists alike to address key questions of platform governance: How do misinformation or hate speech policies compare across platforms and over time? What are the factors that drive platforms to change policies? The PGA is the first online resource of its kind. Its goal is to enhance public knowledge of platform governance by enabling research collaborations and journalistic reporting, and by already providing exemplary analyses of the material.';
